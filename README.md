Once downloaded the zip file from GitHub or cloned the project, in the root folder, run the command "flutter pub get".
P.S.: The firebase files are missing. In order to generate new ones on your own, please write in your terminal, in the root folder of your project, the following commands:

1. firebase login
2. flutterfire config

and follow the instructions to configure flutterfire.
If you do not have flutterfire_cli installed, head to the corresponding installation documentation procedure at: https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?hl=en&platform=ios
